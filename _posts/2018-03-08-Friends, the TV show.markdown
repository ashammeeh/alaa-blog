title: Friends, the TV show, in a different light
---
<p> Recently, I've gotten into the habit of having background noise while I coded, studied,cleaned, or even sleep. And since music could get annoying and redundant, I've gotten into the habit of watching Friends on Netflix. I've noticed, though, how problematic the show would be precieved as if it was showing now. Out of curiostity, I searched up and found <a href= "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/friends-netflix-sitcom-problem-sexism-men-joey-phoebe-chandler-ross-rachel-a8168976.html">this article</a> that is quite interesting in pointing out why it perhaps wouldn't be fitting today.
