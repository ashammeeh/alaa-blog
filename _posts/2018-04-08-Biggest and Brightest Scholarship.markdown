This text post is a responce to the article <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/gradebook/2018/01/04/house-democrat-calls-for-end-to-best-and-brightest-bonuses/"> here </a>
<p>Other than the discrimination among educators and students, basing a teacher’s performance on a standardized test that already is controversial in the sense of it raises the question of effectiveness as a test, seems to be a case that could easily fail. What says these educators won’t cheat on these exams? There is also already backfire against the SAT/ACT exams. If these exams were fair, why are there numerous articles upon articles of “tips and tricks to ace the SAT/ACT”? Logically, it seems as though basing the performance of teachers on a standardized exam is a faulty decision and implementation. </p>
<p>	The “Biggest and Brightest” merit scholarship for teachers seemingly has lot in store for students that are included. Though, there is no clear evidence that giving teachers bonuses to keep them in these public schools will necessarily increase the performance of the students. In addition, the communities that show need for highly-effective soldiers often are forgotten in these scholarship programs. And thus, while this could have been a legislation that would have been helpful for many, there is clearly a gap with the access between students and teachers alike. </p>
