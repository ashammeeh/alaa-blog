title: "Kick the Bucket"
---

<p>Surprisingly enough, the origin of the term comes from computing literature. The use of a “bucket” meant to compartmentalize data in <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/134218/where-and-when-did-bucket-list-come-to-mean-what-it-does-today">a simple computing system. </a> “Bucket sort” was the term used to refer to the compartmentalization. And thus, a bucket would be used to buffer for the data. From this, the contribution to“bucket list” came about. Compartmentalization, clearly, became abstract and broad enough to refer to a list made.</p>
<p>The term actually starts to cross over to everyday language far before it was prevalent in computing system. It seems that another side of the origin of the term comes from the 16th century, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2067,00.html">where it came from the yoke that was used to hold pigs while they were being slaughtered.</a> From this came the connection to human connection to suicide, when they began to attribute it with the act of slaughtering. It is also said that the wooden frame that was used to hang animals up was called a bucket, and with the spasms due to sudden death, <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/kick-the-bucket.html">they would literally kick the bucket under them. </a> And thus, the birth of “kick the bucket” in the 1800s took place. While it seems strange a term so dark would find its way into 21st century practice, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1023235403250.pdf">a psychology experiment done in 1999 </a> showed that the term actually held more relevance than one would expect, and explains how it stayed alive since. Upon asking participants about the term “kick the bucket,” they had the connection that the term captures quick death.
